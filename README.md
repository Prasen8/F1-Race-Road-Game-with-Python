# F1-Race-Road-Game-with-Python

F1 Race Road Game
Overview
This project is a simple 2D racing game built using Python's Pygame library. The player controls an F1 race car and attempts to avoid obstacles on the road while the car continuously moves forward. The game tracks the player's score (based on how many obstacles are dodged) and saves the highest score achieved.

Features
Car movement: The player can move the car left or right using arrow keys (←, →) or A/D keys.
Pause functionality: The game can be paused using the spacebar and resumed with the same key.
Dynamic speed: As the player progresses, the speed of obstacles increases, making the game more challenging.
Crash detection: The game ends if the car crashes into an obstacle or goes off the road.
High score tracking: The game saves and displays the highest score achieved.

Controls
Arrow Keys or A/D: Move the car left or right.
Spacebar: Pause and resume the game.
Escape Key: Quit the game or exit the current screen.
